**Version:** {version_tag}
**Generated On:** {datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")}

## 1. Model Details
- **Architecture:** Hybrid Ensemble (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, PyTorch TabNet, FT-Transformer) stacked via Meta-Learner.
- **Survival Analysis:** Random Survival Forest & DeepSurv neural network.
- **Task:** Predict land acquisition delays (binary classification) and estimate delay duration/cost impacts.

## 2. Intended Use
- **Primary Use Case:** Proactive risk identification for Land Acquisition for Indian projects (Highways, Railways, Airports, Renewable Energy).
- **Out of Scope:** Small-scale municipal projects or projects outside of the defined taxonomy.

## 3. Performance Metrics (Latest Hold-out)
- **ROC-AUC (Classification):** {perf.get('roc_auc', 'N/A')}
- **Expected Calibration Error (ECE):** {perf.get('ece', 'N/A')}
- **Composite Risk Score RMSE:** {perf.get('rmse', 'N/A')}
- **Evaluated At:** {perf.get('timestamp', 'N/A')}

## 4. Explainability & Fairness
- **Methodology:** Dual-Paradigm explanation utilizing TreeSHAP (for gradient boosting models) and internal sequential attention masks (for PyTorch TabNet).
- **Compliance:** Oversampling was exclusively handled via `SMOTENC` during the `.fit()` phase strictly to avoid target leakage and categorical corruption.

## 5. Limitations & Risk Factors
- **Data Drift:** The model's validity degrades if macroeconomic factors shift. Continuous monitoring via Population Stability Index (PSI) is active.
- **Recommendations:** Auto-generated recommendations should act as decision-support tools and not replace human legal/engineering judgment.
